      Work isn’t just about getting a paycheck; hard work builds character,
      promotes dignity, and gives you control over your life. But some folks
      don’t see it that way. As Sam Ewing, the professional baseball player,
      said, “Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their
      sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don’t turn up at all.”

      Some people will do anything to get out of work. Examples range from those
      who say a job is “beneath them,” to folks who want to start at the top
      without paying their dues. Some folks try to get by with sheer
      personality, while others dodge work by hiding in the corner and then
      stealing the credit. Additionally, some people request promotions or
      demand more pay, not because it’s earned, but because they want it. In all
      these cases, the common denominator is the same — hard work is not part of
      the equation. What none of these folks realize is that hard work isn’t a
      punishment; it’s a gift.
